// Real jellyfin-web navigation, not a raw hash assignment, ported from the
// original Jellio codebase's own persistentSidebar.js: window.Emby.Page
// (components/router/appRouter.js, exposed globally, confirmed real) is
// what every native link goes through, its show() records a real push.
// A bare `location.hash =` only fires the native hashchange event, and
// react-router's hash history treats any change it did not itself push
// through navigate() as a pop, indistinguishable from a real back press,
// which misbehaves on any route this runtime has not taken over yet.
// Falls back to the raw assignment only if the real router is not there.
//
// Real bug, found live from the player screen specifically: Emby.Page.show()
// runs through native's own route guard (auth.js's own header explains
// why), and that guard's own internal "where am I" state can be out of
// sync with the real address bar on a route only this runtime ever
// took over, since native never itself ran a real transition into it.
// show() throwing there used to abort navigateTo entirely with nothing
// falling back, reported live as Back doing nothing at all, not even
// the address bar moving. Same real philosophy the history patch below
// already uses: losing native's own route guard integration for the
// one real route it does not recognize is an acceptable degradation,
// leaving the reader stuck on a dead screen is not.
// Real target, not just "did window.location.hash change at all": a
// route guard declining the transition can also leave the address bar
// exactly where navigateTo's own caller already was, a real case a
// plain equality check against the hash before this call would read
// as "it worked" for.

// window.history.pushState()/replaceState(), never a bare hash
// assignment. pushState/replaceState never fire hashchange, only a
// user's own back/forward press or a direct location.hash write do, so
// every native-routed click this runtime hands off to Emby.Page.show()
// changed the address bar and never reached this router at all. Real
// bug, found live: Movies, Shows, Search, Watchlist and every card's
// own click handler visibly changed the URL and rendered nothing.
// Patching both, the same technique any analytics script already uses
// to see SPA navigation it did not initiate itself, is the only way to
// hear a pushState call fire without owning the router that makes it.
// try/catch around the assignment itself, not just its call: this file
// is an ES module, always strict mode, and a strict-mode assignment to
// a non-writable property throws instead of failing silently. If
// window.history[method] is ever locked down (a frozen history object,
// some embedding this codebase has not seen), that throw happened at
// top-level module evaluation, aborting this whole module's own
// execution before it reached a single addEventListener call below,
// and everything that imports it with it: reported live as the reskin
// not loading at all. Losing pushState detection on a client where
// this cannot be patched is a real, acceptable degradation; losing the
// entire runtime over it is not.
